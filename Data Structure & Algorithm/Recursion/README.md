## Recursion

- we need to do lots of repeating things
- recursion is a way to do it
- it's a functional apporach
- it's a way to think about how we can solve problems

- 3 thumbs of rules for recursion
- there must be a base case
- base case is when we reach the end of the problem
- base case dont do recursive calls
- there must be a recursive case
- recursive case is when we need to solve the problem recursively
- recursive case calls the same function again
- it should call itself and make smaller and smaller problems
- it should keep calling itself until it reaches the base case
